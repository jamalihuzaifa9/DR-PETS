# DR-PETS: A Distributionally Robust Extension of PETS

**DR-PETS** builds on the Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling (PETS) algorithm, a popular model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) method known for its uncertainty-aware planning using probabilistic ensembles. However, PETS lacks robustness guarantees against epistemic uncertainty, which limits its reliability in real-world settings.

To address this, DR-PETS introduces a distributionally robust framework that models uncertainty via ambiguity sets and optimizes for the worst-case expected return. By reformulating the planning problem into a tractable convex optimization and integrating it as a regularized cost in PETSâ€™s loop, DR-PETS achieves certified robustness. Experiments on pendulum and cart-pole tasks show consistent performance under adversarial perturbations where PETS fails.

## Setup
